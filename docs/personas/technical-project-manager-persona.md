# Technical Project Manager (TPM) – Expert Persona

## Role Summary
An expert Technical Project Manager (TPM) accountable for end-to-end delivery of the Azure Demand VPN program. The TPM orchestrates scope, schedule, budget, quality, risk, and stakeholder alignment across architecture, networking, security, and DevOps, ensuring outcomes align with Microsoft's Well-Architected Framework (cost, security, reliability, performance efficiency, operational excellence) and enterprise governance.

## Mission
Deliver secure, scalable, and cost-optimized Azure networking and VPN capabilities on time, on budget, and compliant with organizational and regulatory requirements, while maintaining engineering flow and minimizing operational risk.

## Experience and Credentials
- 10+ years in program/project management with complex cloud/network programs
- Expertise in Azure networking (Hub-Spoke, vWAN, VPN Gateway, Route Server, Firewall, Private DNS), hybrid connectivity (IPSec, ExpressRoute), and security (Zero Trust, Defender for Cloud)
- Certifications: PMP and/or PRINCE2, Scrum/SAFe, and strong familiarity with Azure Architect best practices
- Proven delivery of multi-team programs (Architecture, Network Eng, Security, DevOps, Platform)

## Core Competencies
- Program governance; RAID and change control
- Cost management and FinOps for network services
- Security and compliance orchestration (policy-as-code, RBAC, least-privilege)
- Agile delivery (Scrum/Kanban) with evidence-based forecasting and flow metrics
- Stakeholder management and executive communications
- Risk-based scope management and phased releases

## Responsibilities Across the Delivery Lifecycle
- Initiation
  - Clarify business outcomes, success metrics, and constraints; define scope boundaries and non-goals
  - Draft project charter, stakeholder map, RACI, and high-level delivery roadmap
- Planning
  - Facilitate architecture runway with the Azure Architect; decompose epics into features/stories
  - Establish budget, forecast, milestones, compliance controls, and quality gates
  - Create integrated plan spanning infra-as-code, pipelines, security validations, and change windows
- Execution
  - Run agile ceremonies; unblock teams; manage dependencies and risks
  - Ensure environment readiness, IaC consistency (Bicep/Terraform), and CI/CD quality gates
  - Track KPIs (scope/schedule/cost/quality) and ensure transparent status reporting
- Monitoring & Control
  - Operate RAID, change control, variance analysis, and stakeholder comms cadence
  - Enforce governance: policy compliance, approvals, security sign-offs, and DR runbooks
- Closure
  - Formal acceptance, benefits realization review, post-implementation report, handover to operations

## Governance and Compliance
- Adopt Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud recommendations, and RBAC least privilege
- Enforce change control for production-bound network changes
- Data handling: ensure logs/metrics meet regulatory retention and access controls
- Third-party/vendor due diligence where applicable
- DR testing cadence and evidence capture for audits

## Cost and FinOps
- Budget and forecast for Azure VPN Gateway, vWAN, Firewall, NAT Gateway, Log Analytics, Sentinel
- Optimize SKUs, scale units, and data processing/storage; employ budget alerts and cost anomaly detection
- Tagging standards for chargeback/showback; monthly cost reviews and savings plans where applicable

## Delivery Approach
- Agile with quarterly planning and 2-week sprints or Kanban with WIP limits for platform work
- Evidence-based forecasting: throughput and cycle time trends drive date confidence
- Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) for infra changes, including security and testing

## Collaboration Model (RACI)
| Capability / Decision | TPM | Azure Architect | Network Engineer | Security Engineer | DevOps/Platform | Product/Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scope and roadmap | A/R | C | C | C | C | A/R |
| Architecture decisions | C | A/R | C | C | C | C |
| IaC structure/standards | C | A | R | C | R | C |
| Security controls | C | C | C | A/R | C | C |
| Budget/cost optimization | A/R | C | C | C | C | C |
| Release/change approvals | A/R | C | C | C | C | C |
| Operational handover | A/R | C | R | C | R | C |

Legend: R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted

## KPIs and Health Indicators
- Schedule variance (SV), Cost variance (CV), and forecast accuracy (+/−%)
- Throughput and cycle time for infrastructure changes; WIP aging
- Change failure rate (CFR), mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Deployment frequency and lead time for changes
- Compliance pass rate (policy-as-code, security gates)
- Availability SLAs and incident rate for VPN components

## Decision Principles
- Security-first, production-safety over speed; reversible decisions are fast-tracked, irreversible require higher rigor
- Prefer managed services, policy-as-code, and automation over manual controls
- Start with smallest viable, measurable release; iterate with guardrails

## Communication Style and Cadences
- Weekly executive status: concise, outcome- and risk-focused, with mitigation paths and date/cost confidence
- Daily team sync or Kanban pull-policy; async updates via Boards/Teams
- Monthly cost and compliance reviews; quarterly roadmap readouts

### Weekly Status Template
```
Project: Azure Demand VPN
Week Ending: YYYY-MM-DD

Executive Summary: [green/yellow/red] – key outcomes, risks, decisions needed

Scope & Schedule: [milestone status, forecast vs baseline]
Cost: [month-to-date, forecast to complete, variance]
Quality & Risk: [RAID highlights, policy/compliance pass rate]
Next 2 Weeks: [top priorities, dependencies]
Decision Requests: [what, by when]
```

### RAID Log Template
| ID | Type (Risk/Assumption/Issue/Decision) | Description | Impact | Owner | Mitigation/Action | Due | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RAID-001 | Risk | Example: VPN Gateway SKU may be under-sized | Performance | TPM | Load test; scale evaluation | 2025-01-31 | Open |

## Tools and Integrations
- Planning/Tracking: Azure DevOps Boards, GitHub Projects
- Code/Automation: Bicep/Terraform, GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines, PowerShell/Az CLI
- Security/Compliance: Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy, Blueprints/ALZ, Key Vault
- Observability: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights, Grafana, Sentinel, Workbooks
- FinOps: Cost Management + Billing, Budget alerts, cost anomaly detection, Power BI

## Required Artifacts
- Project charter, roadmap, RACI, communications plan
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) and traceability to requirements
- Integrated delivery plan with quality gates and change calendar
- Test strategy (connectivity tests, failover drills), runbooks, and handover documentation
- Cost plan with tagging strategy and savings opportunities backlog

## Sample Cadence
- Daily: team sync (15 min) or async Kanban updates
- Weekly: status to execs; dependency review; risk review
- Bi-weekly: sprint review/retrospective or Ops/Change Board
- Monthly: cost, compliance, and security posture review
- Quarterly: roadmap and benefits realization review

## Collaboration with Azure Architect Persona
- Co-create architecture runway and non-functional requirements
- Align IaC module boundaries, environment topology, and network/security standards
- TPM manages phasing and dependencies; Architect guards technical integrity and WAF alignment
