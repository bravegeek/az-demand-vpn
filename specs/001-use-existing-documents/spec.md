## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What is the required operational log retention period? ‚Üí A: 5 days
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent VPN provisioning requests from the same user/tenant? ‚Üí A: Cancel first request - replace with new request
- Q: What is the default idle timeout period before automatic VPN shutdown? ‚Üí A: 10 min
- Q: What should happen when VPN provisioning fails due to cloud resource quota limits? ‚Üí A: Retry with exponential backoff - attempt up to 3 times
- Q: What is the expected maximum number of concurrent VPN users the system should support? ‚Üí A: 3

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a remote worker or system administrator, I need to securely access private network resources on-demand without maintaining expensive always-on VPN infrastructure. The system should provision a VPN connection when I need it and automatically tear it down when I'm done, minimizing operational costs while maintaining security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no active VPN exists, **When** user requests VPN access, **Then** system provisions a secure VPN endpoint and provides connection credentials within 2 minutes
2. **Given** an active VPN connection, **When** user disconnects or remains idle for the configured timeout period, **Then** system automatically deprovisions the VPN infrastructure and stops billing
3. **Given** user has valid credentials, **When** user connects to VPN endpoint, **Then** user can securely access private network resources with encrypted traffic
4. **Given** VPN is provisioned, **When** user requests connection details, **Then** system provides client configuration files compatible with standard VPN clients
5. **Given** VPN operations are running, **When** system encounters errors or security events, **Then** all events are logged for audit and troubleshooting

### Edge Cases
- What happens when VPN provisioning fails due to cloud service quota limits? System retries with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts before failing
- How does system handle concurrent requests from multiple users? System supports maximum of 3 concurrent users; additional requests are queued or rejected
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during active VPN session? Idle timeout monitor detects lack of activity and automatically terminates dead connections after configured timeout period
- How does system handle certificate expiration for VPN authentication? WireGuard cryptographic keys do not expire; key rotation is manual operational procedure outside system scope
- What happens if automatic shutdown fails or is interrupted? System retries ACI deprovision operation; persistent failures logged for manual intervention
- When concurrent provisioning requests occur from same user, system cancels in-progress request and starts new one

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Provisioning and Lifecycle**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provision VPN infrastructure on-demand within 2 minutes of user request
- **FR-002**: System MUST deprovision VPN infrastructure within 1 minute of shutdown request
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically shutdown idle VPN connections after configurable timeout period (default: 10 minutes) to minimize costs
- **FR-004**: System MUST retry provisioning with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts) when cloud resource quotas or limits are exceeded, then fail if unsuccessful
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce only one active VPN instance per user or tenant to control costs; when concurrent provisioning requests occur from the same user/tenant, system MUST cancel the in-progress request and start the new request

**Client Configuration and Access**
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate client configuration files automatically upon VPN provisioning
- **FR-007**: System MUST support WireGuard cryptographic key-based authentication for VPN access (public/private key pairs)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide connection details (IP address, port, credentials) to authorized users
- **FR-009**: Client configurations MUST be compatible with standard VPN client software
- **FR-010**: System MUST support configuration delivery via secure download or QR code for mobile devices

**Security and Authentication**
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users before allowing VPN provisioning requests (API key authentication primary, Azure AD integration future)
- **FR-012**: System MUST use WireGuard cryptographic key-based VPN authentication as primary method (public/private key pairs, not X.509 certificates)
- **FR-013**: System MUST encrypt all VPN traffic using industry-standard encryption protocols
- **FR-014**: System MUST restrict VPN provisioning requests to authorized source IP ranges when configured per user (stored in UserTenant.allowedSourceIPs optional field)
- **FR-015**: System MUST store all secrets, keys, and certificates securely
- **FR-016**: System MUST enforce least-privilege access to all infrastructure components

**Monitoring and Operations**
- **FR-017**: System MUST log all VPN provisioning and deprovisioning events with timestamps
- **FR-018**: System MUST log all authentication attempts (success and failure)
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide health status information for active VPN endpoints
- **FR-020**: System MUST track VPN connection metrics (duration, bandwidth, client count)
- **FR-021**: System MUST alert administrators when VPN provisioning or operational failures occur
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide cost tracking for VPN resource usage

**Reliability and Performance**
- **FR-023**: System MUST maintain 99.5% availability during business hours (defined as Monday-Friday 6:00 AM - 10:00 PM Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays)
- **FR-024**: System MUST respond to status queries within 5 seconds
- **FR-025**: System MUST handle VPN connection establishment within 30 seconds
- **FR-026**: System MUST implement retry logic for transient cloud service failures
- **FR-027**: System MUST support graceful degradation when cloud resources are temporarily unavailable (implemented via retry logic with exponential backoff per FR-026, returning 503 Service Unavailable with retry-after headers to clients)
- **FR-028**: System MUST support a maximum of 3 concurrent VPN users

**Data Management**
- **FR-029**: System MUST persist VPN configurations for active sessions
- **FR-030**: System MUST clean up expired client configurations automatically
- **FR-031**: System MUST retain operational logs for 5 days minimum
- **FR-032**: System MUST backup critical configuration data for disaster recovery (satisfied by Azure Storage geo-redundant replication and Key Vault backup features)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **VPN Session**: Represents an active VPN provisioning instance with attributes including session ID, user/tenant identifier, provisioning timestamp, public IP address, connection status, and idle timeout configuration

- **Client Configuration**: Represents VPN client setup information including configuration file content, authentication certificates, connection parameters, expiration timestamp, and delivery method (download/QR code)

- **UserTenant**: Represents an authorized entity (user or tenant) that can request VPN access with attributes including authentication credentials, authorization level, quota limits, and usage history

- **Operational Event**: Represents system events and audit trail including event type (provisioning/deprovisioning/authentication/error), timestamp, user identifier, outcome status, and associated metadata

- **Infrastructure State**: Represents current cloud resource allocation including active VPN instances, resource usage metrics, quota consumption, and cost accumulation
